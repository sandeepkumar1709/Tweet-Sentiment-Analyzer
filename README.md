# Tweet Sentiment Analyzer
The Tweet Sentiment Analyzer is a web application designed to analyze sentiments expressed in tweets related to specific events. Leveraging machine learning (ML) algorithms, it categorizes tweets into three distinct sentiments: pre-event, current, and post-event. This classification provides users with valuable insights into the overall sentiment surrounding an event.

# Key Components:
Data Cleaning and Processing Challenges:
We encountered significant challenges related to data quality during development:
Noise Reduction: Removing irrelevant or spammy tweets.
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, and special character removal.
Handling Emojis and Slang: Dealing with non-standard language expressions.
Imbalanced Classes: Ensuring balanced training data.
# Machine Learning Algorithms:
The heart of the system lies in ML algorithms:
Naive Bayes: Probabilistic classification based on word frequencies.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Decision boundaries for sentiment classes.
These algorithms process tweet content, considering features like keywords, sentiment-bearing phrases, and context.
Sentiment Classification:
Pre-Event Sentiment: Analyzes tweets leading up to the event. Are people excited, anxious, or indifferent?
Current Sentiment: Focuses on real-time tweets during the event. Is the sentiment positive, negative, or neutral?
Post-Event Sentiment: Examines tweets after the event. Did it leave a positive or negative impact?
# Web Application Stack:
Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for routing and views.
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap: Create the user interface (UI) and styling.
Direct Model Integration:
Instead of microservices, we’ve embedded the trained sentiment analysis model directly within the Flask application.
When a user submits a tweet, Flask invokes the model for sentiment prediction.
# Workflow:
A user accesses the web application via a browser.
The front-end interacts with the Flask back-end.
Flask routes requests to the sentiment analysis model.
Results are presented to the user in an intuitive UI.
Challenges and Considerations:
Data Quality: Ensuring reliable and relevant tweet data.
Model Training: Regularly retraining ML models to adapt to changing language patterns.
Scalability: Handling a large volume of tweets during trending events.
Security: Protecting user data and preventing misuse.
In summary, the Tweet Sentiment Analyzer combines data cleaning expertise, direct model integration, and a user-friendly Flask web interface. We’re committed to refining our approach based on real-world challenges and feedback!
